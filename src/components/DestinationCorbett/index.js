                <p className='dest-text'>Away from the crowd packed like sardines, nestling in the foothills of the mighty Himalayas,
                lies this beautiful peace of earth called Corbett. River Ramganga quietly flows cutting this valley into two.
                The upper regions boast of thick vegetation while the lower grass lands sway gently with the cool northerly
                winds.</p>
                <p className='dest-text'>There are more than 50 species of mammals and close to 400 species of birds on this park. The park has
                three major zones. Dhikala is the most favourite zone. One has to stay inside the forest rest house to explore
                this part of the park. Dhikala is known for its vast grass lands, water body and sal forests.</p>
                <p className='dest-text'>Guests who want to visit the other zones have an option of staying in one of the resorts situated at Ramnagar
                or can also opt to stay inside the forest rest houses. The other two famous zones are Bijrani and Jhirna.
                Dotted with thick shrubs, river beds, and rocky mountains, Bijrani is a very interesting zone. It boasts of a
                high population of animals and birds.</p>
                <p className='dest-text'>Jhirna as a zone is known for its high density of elephant population. Though the big cat sighting here is very
                tricky, it has been my favourite zone. The tigers here are huge!! And one sighting here will be edged till the
                end. This zone also boasts a variety of bird life. The serene landscape of this zone keeps everyone on their
                seat during the jungle drives.</p>
