            <hr/>
            <p className='list-style'>Arrive at the Bandipur resort by 12 noon. Complete your checking formalities, take a little
            rest and proceed for lunch. Lunch is served at the Gol Ghar. Post lunch head towards the first
            safari inside the jungle. Safaris would be by jeeps and our very well trained Naturalists and guides
            would drive you through the jungle and share a lot of interesting stories and share their knowledge
            about the flora and fauna of the jungle. Return to the resort for a hot cup of beverage. Freshen up
            and enjoy your evening at the camp fire. Dinner would be served post 8PM. Retire for the day after
            dinner. ( L D )</p>

            <hr/>
            <p className='list-style'>The friendly staff of the resort would give you a wake up call early in the morning. Freshen
            up and proceed to the designated area for your favourite cup of hot tea/coffee. Board your vehicles
            and head inside the jungle for a exciting morning safari. Winters are mystical here. The fog gets
            slowly cleared as the Sun comes out lazily through the clouds. The chirping winter migratory birds
            are busy hunting their morning food. On a lucky day you would get to sight the majestic leopards
            basking on the tree tops or on the rocks. This is quite a common sight during winters.<br/>

            Return to the resort for a nice breakfast and much needed rest. Post lunch enjoy one more
            afternoon safari inside the jungle. Dinner and stay at the resort. ( B L D )</p>
