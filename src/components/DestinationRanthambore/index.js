                <p className='dest-text-2'>The Ranthambore forests are so huge that it has been divided into ten zones. It actually takes more
                than a ten day stay to explore the whole jungle. If time permits, we strongly suggest for a long
                haul holiday. The forests has got a lot of remains of the old forts built centuries back by the kings.
                The sight of the forests itself is surreal. With the Tiger this forests looks magical. The rocky
                outcrops with grass lands and wetlands makes this terrain completely different from the other
                jungles of India. Summers do get very hot but it is the best time for tiger sightings. Winters turn this
                place into a fairy land. There are no elephants but a lot of deers, black bears, leopards and birds
                who have made this place their home. Tigers of course are the main attraction.</p>
                <p className='dest-text-2'>One has to book the safari 120 days prior to the date of travel ( for core zones especially ). Buffer
                zones can be done on current booking basis but one has to go the counter and book it. Safaris are
                also booked by the resort where you would be staying or your tour operators&#39; can assist in your
                safari bookings.</p>
                <p className='dest-text-2'><b>Sawai Modhupur market</b>  - The local market can be visited after the safaris to purchase
                souvenirs, clothes, paintings and printed scarfs. Most of the products revolve around the tiger. One
                can also taste some local food ( definitely spicy for foreign nationals ) at select outlets, though it is
                suggested to have food at your selected resorts.</p>
                <p className='dest-text-2'><b>Jaipur - the city of Royals</b> - is a must visit place for its richnesss and traditions. The palaces here
                speak the life of the yesteryear kings and their lifestyle. The city has got numerous palaces to visit.
                And one can indulge in some very tasty local Rajasthani food in the multiple restaurants available
                in this place. It is strongly suggested to stay over for a couple of days in Jaipur either in the
                begining or end of your tour to Ranthambore.</p>
