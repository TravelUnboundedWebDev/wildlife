              <p className='list-style'>Once upon a time, there lived a tigress called Parwali.She ruled a large territory alongside the Ramganga river in Corbett Tiger reserve, Dhikala zone..</p>
              <p className='list-style'>She had some unique behaviours. She used to come down and sit in small water pool. It was fondly called her swimming pool!! She used to swim across Ramganga river and cover the area called Sambhar road.</p>
              <p className='list-style'>She mated several times, but she successfully could bring up only her last litter. She had three cubs.</p>

          <div className='col-12 col-md-6 col-xl-6 col-lg-6 main-head-right'>
              <p className='list-style'>As it generally happens, the cubs grew under the strict
                guidance of their Mother. They quickly learnt to hunt and
                time passed by. In just over two years, one of her cubs started
                to dominate the other two. Then came a day when she
                confronted her Mother. This may sound sad, but Nature
                always wants the fittest to survive. She managed to chase her
                Mother away and she took over her reigns and the territory.</p>
              <p className='list-style'>The other two sisters also were chased away from the
                territory. She was named ‘Parwali Junior’. She exactly follows
                her Mother’s foot steps and is sighted many times in the
                swimming pool. The other sister, also managed to chose a
                territory bordering Jr Parwali’s. She had a very peculiar
                behaviour of climbing trees. This gave her the name
                ‘Pedwali’.</p>
          </div>

          <div className='col-12 col-md-6 col-xl-6 col-lg-6 main-head-right'>
              <p className='list-style'>Both the sisters were now grown and were known for their
                excellent hunting skills. They became ‘The famous two’ and
                were very regularly getting sighted at the Dhikala zone by the
                guests. Time had come for them to search for a mate. They
                found a huge male. Soon magic happened!! Pedwali gave
                birth to three cubs and Parwali gave birth to four cubs. We
                were lucky to get Pedwali with her cubs on Sambhar road on
                Jan 2nd 2024. We couldn’t get to Jr Parwali’s area as the
                bridge across the river Ramganga is still not built and would
                be done by Jan 2024 end. But the forest guards on the other
                side of the river have seen her with her tiny ones. The cubs
                are now 3 to 4 months old.</p>

                to Ramnagar and Dhikala zone during April and May 2024.
                All cubs look very healthy and would be around 8 to 9
                months during your trip/s. This is a great time to visit
                Corbett with us and explore the beauty of the jungle along
                with these little ones.</p>

              <p className='list-style'>Our biggest surprise, was when one of Pedwali’s cubs started climbing the tree, exactly how her Mother does!</p>
              <p className='list-style'>This is going to be one of the finest stories of the tigers of Corbett. Lessons passed on from the Grand Mother to the Mother and now to the cubs.</p>
              <p className='list-style'>It is time for you to check out whether one of the cubs of Jr Parwali also likes to spend time in the swimming pool like her Mother and Grand Mother.</p>

              <p className='list-style'>Another surprise which awaits you, is the leopardess which has also one cute little cub, which
                is about 7 to 8 months old. She has set up home very close to Sambhar road. These two are
                very frequently sighted, perched on tree branches. We were very lucky to get them resting on
                the tree branch. This tree is very close to the SAL ( main ) road you take to reach the Dhikala
                FRH. It is very easy to spot them if they are around. This cub is also bold like his Mother.</p>
              <p className='list-style'>It would be really exciting to see this cub survive with Pedwali and cubs living so close to her
                home!!</p>
              <p className='list-style'>This is going to be a great time for you all at Corbett during April or May 2024.</p>
